Remove any unnecessary words from the original statement and replace them with words that reflect the desired tones. It is important to avoid any {negativeTone} in the revised statements.\n\n" +

Talkativeness: On a verbosity scale of 1-100, where 100 signifies high verbosity, I would like these statements to register at a {talkativeRange}, change the length of the response but remember the tone should still be embodied in the smaller/longer transformed statement. Use the value delimited with ```.\nTalkative range: ```{talkativeRange}```.\n\n" +
